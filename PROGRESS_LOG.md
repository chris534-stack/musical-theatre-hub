# Progress Log

## 2025-04-27
- Fixed a critical runtime error where the `Calendar` component could receive an object instead of an array for its `events` prop, causing `.map is not a function` errors on the calendar page. Now, the code always ensures an array is passed.
- Successfully built the project after the fix, with no errors or warnings.
- Previous fixes included resolving TypeScript errors and updating event filtering logic to return `{ events, skipped }` objects.
- All changes committed and pushed to git after each milestone.

---

**Next steps:**
- Monitor for any further runtime issues or edge cases.
- Ready for deployment or further feature development.
